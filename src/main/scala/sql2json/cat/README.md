`sql2json.cat`
==============

The implementations of these typeclasses are ripped directly from the [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/) library. 

This exists primarily because of a convergence of factors:

1. I like programming using these typeclasses

2. If there's a release of Cats for Dotty, I couldn't find it in the amount of 
   time I wanted to put into locating it.

3. Translating the subset of the implementation here was more fodder for learning Dotty
